# ReTime_CA

## An open-source Python-based tool for real-time control applications.

**You can download the application paper [here](https://revistadigital.amca.mx/a-python-based-open-source-software-for-real-time-control-systems/)**

Such paper introduces this open-source Python software, which achieves a high performance for the sampled period (high runing in a PC), despite running on a general-purpose operating system instead of a real-time operating system. The software is designed to implement control systems and experiment with physical platforms, particularly the Quanser Qube-Servo 2 (It is a free aporach to use this plataform). This article describes the coding design, numerical methods, modeling, and identification of the Qube-Servo 2, the control design, and its implementation. Finally, a quick guide to downloading via GitHub and installation requirements are provided.
